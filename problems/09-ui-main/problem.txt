PROBLEM

How can we navigate to accounts and transactions from the main page? We can add links to the navigation bar!

1. Add the link to accounts in the home page's nav bar in nav bar.
2. Add the link to transactions in the home page's nav bar in nav bar.
3. Change the h1 text to Online Banking in the main template.

HINTS

The database must be running in its own window/tab or in detached mode. To start the DB, run `$ mongod`.
The webdriver must be running with `$ webdriver start`.

The main template is in the /client/app/main/main.html: <h1>Online Banking</h1>

The navigation bar is in the app/components/navbar/navbar.html.
